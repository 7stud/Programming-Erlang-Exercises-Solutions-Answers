# Solutions for the Exercises in Programming Erlang
Programming Erlang (2nd Ed.) Joe Armstrong

**Erlang 17.5**  (The book was written for that version, so that's the version I'm using.)

In chapter 13, I got tired of typing commands in the erlang shell to compile and run tests for my programs, so I created a shell script to compile and test my erlang programs with one command:
```
$ ./run
```
See the Chapter 13 directory for [details](https://github.com/7stud/Programming-Erlang-Exercises-Solutions-Answers/blob/master/Chapter%2013/_running_programs.md).

If you have a better or different answer click on Issues and post your answer.  Anyone looking for alternative answers should click on Issues under each chapter.  If you have a question about one of the solutions, post the question in an issue.  While I'm working my way through the book, I'll check back regularly.  After that, not so much.
